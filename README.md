# Documentation
On it's own, messages won't send. To fix this you'll want to create a "log.html" along with these files.
# Warning
This does not come with any spam protection whatsoever, it's best to use this privately and only share with friends you trust.
# Another Warning
If you want to modify this, be careful, this code is an absolute mess.
